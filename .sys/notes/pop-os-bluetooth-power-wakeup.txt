# This describes how to have certain bluetooth devices power up when
# the computer wakes up from suspend, typically for a laptop

# First look for the bluetooth devices via
> cd /sys/bus/usb/drivers

# See the current states of devices on power wakeup
> grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup

# To enable, run the following (note: sudo may get in your way, can just
# vim instead)
> echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/<device>/power/wakeup

# This isn't permanent however, and instead, you want to put that echo
# command inside /etc/rc.local
